# Big-Data-Studying-of-NYC-Taxi-Data
New York City is one of the busiest cities in the world, with millions of people relying on taxis every day. This creates a lot of data about when and where people travel, how much they pay and how long each trip takes. Understanding this data can help improve city planning, reduce traffic and make taxi services more efficient. One big problem is that it's hard to know when and where people need taxis the most. This makes it difficult to manage traffic, assign drivers and set prices fairly for taxi companies. If we can predict high-demand areas and times, taxi companies can send more cars to those places and reduce passenger wait times. Because there are millions of taxi trips each year, the data is very large to store and maintain. This is why we need big data tools like Hadoop, Spark and NoSQL databases. These tools help us store, clean, and analyze the data quickly. With big data methods, we can find useful patterns and make smart decisions from huge amounts of information.
